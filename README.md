# Raspberry Pi RGB Cooling HAT

# Introduction
This is the code to run the Multi-function cooling expansion board designed for the Raspberry Pi 4B as sold on the link below. Its also sold by Yahboom and is compatible with the 4B/3B+/3B to protect Raspberry Pi and extends its life. 
The original code is long out of date and nothing pre-built existed so I patched together this using my limited knowledge of python and the newer libraries that are still active.

The OLED display should show real-time display CPU temperature, CPU usage, hard disk space, memory and IP address. 
The large-size cooling fan is automatically adjusted in speed according to the CPU temperature. 
The 3 high-brightness RGB programming lights on the bottom of the expansion board will light up based on the CPU temperature but you can code them to do whatever you want.
